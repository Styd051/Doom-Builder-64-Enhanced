- Added plugin event OnMapNodesRebuilt which allows plugins to read/modify nodebuilder output.
Added RebuildNodes method in MapManager which allows plugins to rebuild the nodes on demand. and Added Reject Editor plugin by codeimp
- Added -nosettings command line parameter which allows starting Doom Builder with only the default settings (no user settings) but any settings you make will not be saved (to protect your original settings). by codeimp
- Added -strictpatches command line parameter to indicate strict patches loading for the WAD file loaded from command line
Added -resource command line parameter to specify additional resources for the WAD file loaded from command line see cmdargs.txt for more information! by codeimp
- Added some functionality for plugins that want to render in other editing modes by codeimp
- @ Added the DynamicBitmapImage which is much more efficient when updated dynamically (use UpdateTexture after modifying the pixels) by codeimp
- Added the ability for plugins to choose the toolbar section in which to add a button by codeimp
- Fixed a visual glitch which caused incorrect thing colors when selection was cleared from Edit Selection mode. by codeimp

- Added Event Lines functionality, implemented by m-x-d for gzdoombuilder, Currently, the Event Lines code is based on the first version of commit [r1620] on SourceForge, This code may be improved in future, and I will try to import any additional bug fixes that were made by m-x-d for Event Lines later.
- Adds a new menu called Switch Setup to the Preferences menu and adds a new option that allows you to disable and enable the selection of multiple linedefs for Switch Setup. by Styd051
- added  When you hover your mouse cursor over the things, it shows you the linedefs they are connected to, linked to their corresponding tag numbers. by Styd051
- Fixes a bug where, when you place the mouse cursor over the linedef and then remove the mouse cursor from the linedef, the things marked with the corresponding tags remained bright. by Styd051
- Removed the limit on the number of Things in Doom64 formats, because the file format doesn't really impose a limit on this. by Styd051
- Adds a feature when you place the Nightmare flag on a thing the color of its cage now changes to green, Adds a feature when you place the Spawned by Special flag on an thing the color of its sprite turns black, Alpha of PixelColor for the Nightmare flag and set to 255 because the editor does not currently support transparency in visual mode. by Styd051
- Multiple line switch setup
This allows switch setup to be edited across multiple lines. The only oddity is that users can select multiple flags when multiple lines are selected. This is required at the moment to show multiple line differences. Perhaps an onclick of sorts could remedy this in a future update. by Immorpher
- Allow Negative Tags
Doom 64 allows for negative tags, which lets macros to use negative values. So instead of storing tags as ushorts, it stores them as shorts.
The arrow incrementor and tagged highlighting will need to be updated to support negative tags eventually. by Immorpher
- Ignore Global Palette Warning for Doom 64
Doom 64 does not have a global palette, so there should be no warning if it is missing one. by Immorpher
- Add Final Missing Light Actions
These are the final (vanilla) light actions that were not defined yet as linedef specials. by Immorpher
- Fix Multiple Line Switch Checking
This fixes the issue where mappers could check multiple switch flags when selecting multiple lines. The indeterminate state can still be a bit unusual when middle flags are set. by Immorpher
- Allow Negative Tag Highlighting
This finishes the negative tag support for Doom 64! by Immorpher
- Include Event Line Color in Default Configuration by Immorpher
- Fix Make Sector Color Gradient Rounding Bug
When using the "Make Sector Color Gradient" routine, the last sector's color could be altered due to a rounding error because of integer division. Switching some variables to float fixed this bug. by Immorpher
- Improve Sector Color Gradient Again
This further improves some rounding errors due to summation which affects the final light. by Immorpher
- Show Sector Color Gradient Changes Immediately
In 2D mode sector color gradients would not be updated unless the view was refreshed. This fixes that so it updates immediately after the tool is used. by Immorpher
- Show Visual Mode Light Changes in 2D Mode
This allows any copy and pasting of lights in visual mode to be immediately reflected in 2D mode. by Immorpher
- Add DIM-BSP64 Support
DIM-BSP64 is a new node builder with extra features and bug fixes: https://github.com/Immorpher/dim-bsp64 by Immorpher
- Rename the nodebuilder dim-bsp64 to bsp64enhanced, and update the source code to the latest version of the nodebuilder glbsp source code,  and of new functionality added by immorpher.
- BSP64 Enhanced Updates
Clean up the BSP64 Enhanced implementation. This replaces both DIM-BSP64 and DMA-BSP64. by Immorpher
- BSP64 Enhanced Update
This will prevent some enemies from getting stuck in shallow pits in compress edges mode. by Immorpher
- Update BSP64Enhanced
Fixed an issue where copying switch properties and textures across lines can cause a multiple activation bug in sidedef compression. by immorpher

version 1.0.0.0
=====================
- Fixed a potential timing issue on speed-stepping CPUs. by codeimp
- Better timing clock without accuracy loss after long system uptime (should solve camera movement lag issues) by codeimp
- Added basic plugin loading order system (just a cfg file which sets the order in which to load the DLL files, this matters because that is also the order in which events are raised on plugins) by codeimp
- Change the way Things are rendered in classic modes (now use a small, constant amount of video memory instead of linear amount) by codeimp
- @ Fixed a bug in the new way the Things are rendered
Removed code that crashed the script editor and I had no better solution (it was unused code anyway) by codeimp
- Fixed crash when double-clicking a sector in Make Sector Mode by codeimp
- Fixed crash when sectors with lots of sidedefs are created or loaded by codeimp
- Fixed a rounding issue with thing angles that sometimes caused things to display odd angles by codeimp
- Fixed bug in Things Filters which caused removed flag settings to be restored after DB restart. by codeimp
- Fixed crash when saving with spaces at the beginning or end of a typed texture/flat name by codeimp
- Fixed a tiny inaccuracy on a rare occasion in the sector triangulation code by codeimp
- Improved texture filtering in Visual Mode. When filtering is Off, it interpolates the mipmaps to reduce the banding effect on walls/floors. With filtering On, it now uses anisotropic filtering up to level 8. (you can change the anisotropy level by editing the 'filteranisotropy' value in the program configuration) by codeimp
- Fixed a crash when accepting Edit Selection mode changes with erroneous overlapping lines. by codeimp
- Fixed bug which sometimes causes the drawing vertex to jump to (0, 0) while drawing geometry. by codeimp
- Fixed bug in dockers panel system that allowed the panel to go bonkers when resized smaller than possible. by codeimp
- Fixed a bug that caused a zero-length file to be created when a resource file was missing. by codeimp
- Fixed an issue that caused a map to be 'changed' just by going into Visual Mode. by codeimp
- @ Removed some console output code that was used for testing
@ Gave the ThingTypeInfo a string representation (ToString) by codeimp
- Fixed things in Visual Mode not being updated after their type is changed. by codeimp
- Find and Replace Mode: can now find things by their flags by boris_i
- Find and Replace Mode: can now find linedefs by their flags by boris_i
- Reorganize the order of the lindefs flags on the interface for the Doom 64 vanilla and EX+ configurations, and add the flag Block Player to the EX+ configuration since the EX+ engine supports this new feature. by Styd051
- Added support for the EX+ Enhanced engine by Styd051
- I changed the Doom Builder 64  background to my own custom  background that I made myself, It can always be improved in the future. by Styd051
- Added a new visual feature for things in Nightmare Mode, when you place the Nightmare flag on an things, it will automatically change color to green, this allows you to differentiate between things in Nightmare mode and things that are not in Nightmare mode on the map. by Styd051
- renames the name Doom Builder 64 to Doom Builder 64 Enhanced by styd051
- Fixes a bug in the switch setup where when you select multiple lindefs at once and click OK, all the lindefs you have selected will have the Upper, Middle or Lower options of the switch setup applied to all lindefs. by Styd051
- Fixes a bug where, after checking the Middle and Lower boxes, and clicked OK, and returning to the Edit linedef menu, the Middle box is no longer checked, Only the Lower box is checked. by Styd051
- Change the icon of .exe of Doom Builder 64 Very sexy icon! by Styd051
- Replaces the Cacodemon sprite icon from Doom Classic with the Cacodemon sprite from Doom 64, and replaces the Builder16 icon with an icon with the three demonic artifacts. by Styd051
- Added a new DB64Resource.wad file that improves the visual appearance of the Zombie Shotgun, Imp Nightmare, Spectre, Baron of Hell, Red Marine Bot, and Cyan Marine Bot in visual mode on Doom Builder 64, They now use their own sprites with their own colors instead of using the same sprite with a different frame in visual mode, resulting in a visual improvement for mappers, and corrects and renames the name Player Bot Blue to Player Bot Cyan because the marine bot was not blue, but cyan in the game by Styd051
- Restores the Artifact Switch actions in the macro commands that were deleted, and adds the Artifact Switch scripts and all the scripts located in explus.txt to Doom64_BLAM.cfg by Styd051
- The Teleport_Monsters_Only and Start_Light_Strobing actions now support macro commands, and these new macro commands are added to Doom64_BLAM.cfg. by Styd051
- Added Dropoff flags to the EX+ Enhanced and EX+ configurations because these engines support it, this flag This allows jumps from high places for things. by Styd051
-Added support for Diema's dma-bsp64 nodebuilder by Diema
- Add Missing Actions
This adds the missing actions which reference the Global Integer, and fixes some language. Reference: https://www.doom64.com/maps/actions/list.html by Immorpher
- Add the Static Marine
The static marine results from an underflow and is mostly a decorative thing: https://www.doom64.com/maps/things/list.html by Immorpher
- Switch Setup Correction
There has been a long misconception on how Doom 64 switch flags work. For example "Switch Check Height" is not in Doom 64. This corrects for that and simplifies the switch setup based on how the flags actually work here: https://www.doom64.com/maps/linedefs.html by Immorpher
